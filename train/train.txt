Hi John,
On this Friday, a few of us are going to Middlebrook for food and to watch a film. If you’d like to come along too, we’re all meeting at Horwich Parkway train station at around 18:00 before going to the cinema to watch a film, which we’ll decide upon when we get there.

Hi Matt, 
Just come back from holiday in Turkey. It was amazing! So much hotter than I expected. We stayed in Instanbul, in a lovely hotel near the sea. We went swimming pretty much every day. There was also a swimming pool at the hotel, and it had a pool table, table tennis table etc. it was great fun.

Dear Mr.Patel,
I’m emailing about the current state of moss bank park. It would appear that the grass hasn’t been cut in over a year, there’s litter strewn everywhere, and whilst it’s easy to tell people to put litter in the bin, there simply aren’t enough bins around for people to use. Furth

Hi Emma,
Just wondering if you’re out today? If you are do you want to meet me at Costa at about 12:00? Just for a quick catch up if that okay with you. 
Will see you later!

Hi Tony,
Just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed Italy! I went to Milan first and the hotel was so lovely, you would of loved it so much! They had a massive pool on the roof and it was so nice to go and enjoy the hot weather. After that I went to Florence but it was too hot for me. It was hot and dry weather so that ruined my fun a little bit. But I really enjoyed the last place I went to which was Lake Como. I would definitely love to go there again. The weather was perfection and it was so beautiful. 
Anyway I’ll see you back at school,
Claire.

Dear Mr Osbourne
I am writing to inform you about my concern over the environment in the area of Wilmslow. I’m really shocked at the state of things and nothing is being done to tackle this problem. In the local park there is litter everywhere and it’s a constant eyesore of what used to be such a lovely place to go and spend sunny afternoons. The bins are usually overflowing and it can be a while before they are sorted out. I think that something should be done immediately, as it is not nice for the locals to have to se

Hi Jake, want to meet next week? I’m free Friday (the 5th of July), let me know if you want to do something. I was thinking about going to the cinema or something, if you want to go ill meet you in Ashton at the bus station at about 5:30 then we can get the train into Manchester and grab some food. Then go to the Odeon in the print works. See you then ☺ xxx

Hey bek, guess where I’ve been? Yeah I went to Greece, are you jealous? ;) it was awesome, did so much cool stuff, when to the beach almost every day and just ley there getting an awesome tan… went on jet skis and all sorts and the nights were awesome. Best holiday ever; see you when I get back ☺ xxx

Hey John,
About today, I will be seeing you later right? It’s going to be awesome, I heard that Stephen’s party is going to be amazing. Did you hear about Anna? She said the last time she went to one of his parties she felt sick because there was so much music and noise and she danced too much! I think it’s because she wasn’t used to going out much but I guess it’s just her word to believe. I can’t believe it’s Halloween already! 31st October 2013 and I’m definitely ready to trick or treat! By the way, I know on the invitation it said the party started at 7PM but actually it’s changed. It’s now going to start at half 8. His mum is being really strict and is insisting that he must finish his homework before he has some fun. But it’s almost the end of the year and it’s half term, surely it’s time to celebrate? Well, I can’t wait to see you later at 14 Valley Lane. Remember to bring your best Halloween costume!
Stanley.

Hey John,
So you know how I had to go to holiday after the Halloween party right, and boy was that the greatest party ever, I had a real good time in Hawaii. I can’t believe I managed to go all the way to Hawaii by myself, I’m so braze, I didn’t think I had the guts to take a plane to such a far distance. So I danced a lot and I stayed by the beach, it was incredibly hot and I had to put on loads of sun tan lotion. Plus, I met this really nice girl called Sally that stayed in the hotel too, and she is from Algeria! Isn’t that pretty cool? I met someone else around the same age as me that was from another country! I also ate lots of fruit, and I must say that going to Hawaii was definitely better than I had expected. Well I must go now, I have dinner waiting for me, we will be eating this strange food with fish but it actually tastes really nice. When I come home though I hope mother cooks me a good old English breakfast. Catch you later!

Dear Mr Khan,
I am writing a letter of complaint about the recent issues in our local area. There has been an unbelievable amount of antisocial drinking in the neighbourhood, as well as rude smokers that are smoking near children when there are no stop-smoking signs to tell them otherwise. It is ridiculous. My brother plays in the park every day after school, but just as he leaves the park there are many smokers that are just hanging around the back alleys and the exits and they do not seem to care much about my brothers health, even though he is coughing in distress. It is appalling and it must be stopped. Also, yesterday I was doing some work at home when there were two rather loud, drunk men that got into a fight on my street. They did not know each other, they just saw each other and started fighting only until 5 minutes later a man rang up the police to get them arrested. I fear that  my family could have been hurt during this time and I urge that you do something about this. I know there are bans on these demerit goods for a reason but I beg, please do something.

Hey Vicky, haven’t seen you in ages! So I was just wondering if you fancied meeting up for a catch up next Wednesday at say Costa in town? I’ve got a dentist appointment in the morning so it would probably be best to meet around 1.30? Let me know if this would be okay ☺ xx

Hi zoe, I’ve literally just got back from Lanzarote! The weather was amazing every day for the whole week, so I’m pretty tanned haha! We went to the beach most days; I went on a banana boat and one of those pedalo’s with the slides on the back. My mum, and  I  also went parasailing on the Tuesday which was so much fun. The food there is lovely, it’s so nice to eat out every night.  Such a shame to be back in England as the weather is so dull as per usual. Hope to see you soon xxx

Dear Sir, I am writing to you with an issue of concern about the recent library closure in Wakefield. Although there are plans to open a new library in the next year, I am worried that that is a large amount of time for a whole community to go without access to books which may be needed in exam time. Some of the community may not be able to use transport to access other libraries so I am hoping that this email will encourage you to shorten the length of time it will take for a new library to be opened, or perhaps for a temporary one to be set up. 
Yours sincerely, Penny Simmons
<|endoftext|>

Hi we haven’t spoken for a long time how are you? Just wondering whether you are free on the Wednesday 3rd July if not we’ll change it. Anyways I reckon we can have a bite to eat at Nandos, so if we meet there at about 2pm on Wednesday it should be good.  Look forward for your reply.

Hi just got back. The plane was horrific, plus the airport was so busy, but I really loved Ibiza. Ibiza has really beautiful beaches where the shells just lie on the beach waiting for you to collect them. The Spaniards are so polite and humorous too. They made me giggle when they pushed me in the swimming pool. Don’t even get me started on the food, it was gorgeous. British food is so much better but I can’t complain when I’m lay in the sun getting a tan with a gorgeous view. You really should have come, they even had a Michael Jackson tribute act it was hilarious. I hope everything is okay at home.

Dear MP, I would like to know why the library has just shut down. Children relied on this for their education, our area isn’t known for its enthusiasm for learning and you have just took away the option of them actually wanting to go into further education as this town is under privileged we don’t have the money to buy books. There are over 10,000 people on my petition that want the library back and that is over 2/3 of the town so I think you may need to rethink your decision about the library closure, as most of the town is against your decision. I would like your reconsidered reply as soon as possible.

Dear Sir/Madam
I am writing to inform you that the recycle bins in my area keep getting stolen/misplaced. I live in Adswood and my green bin has gone missing a number of times, my black bin once and my blue bin twice.

Hello, recently I have been on holiday to Transylvania. I did this as part of a biology expedition with college, for two weeks. We stayed mostly in tents, but spent a few nights in guest houses. These were still only basic and I was much looking forward to sleeping in my own bed! We got to see loads of animals and even a bear, which was really cool. Hope to see you soon. Sally

Dear Nigel Evans, 
Following Barack Obama’s recent speech regarding a decrease in the possession of nuclear weapons, I think now would be an appropriate time to consider the future of project Trident.
Projects such as this are unnecessary and are in no way helpful in decreasing nuclear warfare across the world. Surely it is hypocritical for us to be again the behaviour of South Korea, for example, yet be hiding a similar potential scheme ourselves?

<|endoftext|>

Dear John Woodcock,
I think that the ticket prices for the buses and also the trains in this area are extortionate and that they need to be lowered then more people would use the public transport. To go on the bus for a 20 minute journey for an adult is about £6.50. I think that you should consider trying to work with the bus and train companies to try and lower their prices not only here but all over the country. 
Yours sincerely

Hi Dave, I just wanted to email you about my recent holiday to Japan. It was great! I visited all sorts of places like the temples, Mt.Fuji and all of the big skyscrapers. The whole culture of Japan is so much different than over in England. Everybody over there is so much more polite and considerate than the people over here. When I was buying a clothing item from a shop over there the women put it in the bag for me and then took it to the end of the shop and waved until I was out of site. It really was an amazing life changing time, and I would love to go again!

Dear Sir, I am emailing you today to tell you about an issue of my concern. The closure of the local leisure centre. This leisure centre has been in the community for years and I know, as I go myself, that a lot of people use these facilities. This is why I am asking you to not close it down and to keep it open to everybody as I know a lot of people who would be upset to see it close down because they also use the facilities very regularly and there isn’t another leisure centre close by. The closest leisure centre around is 10 miles away so people won’t want to travel that distance. Also this facility is used by local scout clubs etc for the community. This is why I am deeply upset and would like you to consider again about

Hey Charlotte!
We have so much to catch up on, I went on a road trip with my parents this summer! It was the best and worst holiday of my life. So, firstly we drove everywhere. And I mean everywhere. ‘Hey look dad, there’s Italy!’ Which, with my family, as you can imagine, was hell. But anyway, we were up this mountain in France and me and my brother decided to take a walk down this country lane. Little did we know it was a private road and land owned by a very scary French farmer. When we got down there, we noticed a lot of DO NOT TRESPASS signs and we even saw a shotgun! We then ran up the hill as fast as possible and managed to escape before he could get out. It was so scary but fun! Anyway how have your holidays been? We also went to Germany, Austria and Switzerland! Miss you lots, hope to see you soon. ☺

Dear Mr Brady,
I am writing to you in order to make you aware of some recent changes in my town which I feel are unjustified and debilitating for the youth in my local area. Recently, a landmark of our village; the local cinema which has been here for over 100 years, was sold to a buyer whom plans to convert the beloved building into a restaurant of his choice. This raises many areas of concern from where I am viewing the situation. Firstly, the cinema attracts many tourists from around the world as it is the only one of its kind in the whole of the UK. It may be small but it is unique to this town and there are a lot of people who would be sad to see it go.

Hi X, 
How are you, I was just thinking of meeting up somewhere this afternoon just to talk about some stuff as we need to catch-up! Why don’t we meet at 2:30 this Friday for a coffee chat at Café Nero in near Piccadilly Gardens? Reply back quickly please. Thanks.

Hey X, 
OMG! I have sooo much to tell you- it’s been amazing! You’d never guess what I did? Okay, okay, I’ll tell you- I did paragliding!!! Yes me!

Lots of love.

Dear MP, 
I am writing to you because I am extremely concerned about our local library closing down. As a student I would like the library to be closer to my house and avoid the large distance and traffic concerns. This way I would be able to have more time to finish my studies and in this way succeed in my chosen subjects. In addition, I hope to see you taking this into consideration because I am not the only student around this area.

As an employee of the National Health Service I have experienced this first hand. The wonderful solution of not replacing staff has caused an imbalance of services. Currently when patients arrive for their appointment there are no admin staff to greet them on the desk. I appreciate that your core priority are clinical staff however the admin staff are the cogs to an efficiently run service. If these are not created you are setting up the health service to fail. I will keep this short and succinct but I would appreciate your thoughts on the matter. Yours Sincerely,Deborah Pearson

Dear Mr. Cameron,I am writing to you to highlight the current situation regarding funding of speech and language therapy courses at university.

And the animals were all out in force, there was a family of PINE MARTENS!!!! living in our garden. I didn't know what a pine marten was prior to this holiday, so if you are wondering it is like of like a stoat or a weasel but very very cute. I thought they were birds...but apparently that is house martens. Huzzah! Also saw a seal and an eagle and some deer. Wicked. And ate my own weight in crappy food. In fact I want to go back there now. How are you guys doing, what have you been up to?E xxx3.Dear Mr Smith,I am writing to you to protest in the strongest possible terms about your proposed withdrawal of funds to our local stroke club. I am not sure if you or anyone within your family has ever had call to attend a stroke club, however they provide a vital service in supporting stroke victims to re-integrate into society, share their concerns, and cope with ongoing disability. The peer support provided by a stroke club is priceless. In discussions with stroke victims, it is often the stroke club they mention more than any other facility in their recovery. Please reconsider. Yours,Disgusted, Stockport.

Hey Kay,
We’re back from Turkey! We had an amazing time there – the weather was fantastic, the place we stayed at was really nice, and the food was OK enough. One of the best things about the hotel was the PUPPY!!! Yes, there was a little puppy living at the hotel! He was SO cute!!! He spent most of the holiday nibbling on our feet, and trying to avoid falling into the pool! 
We went on a couple of trips (well, Heather, Becky, and Anna did). Eleanor and I had to stay back at the hotel for one of the trips though, as I had the shits, and Eleanor stayed back, to make sure I was all right! Actually, I recovered quite quickly, and we just had a really lazy day at the pool, while the other three spent the day having water fights on what sounded like a really mad jeep safari! 
We all got our exam results whilst we were away as well, so we’re very pleased and relieved about that – phew!!! 
Well, now we’re back, we’ll have to meet up really soon! 
Love, Aileen. Xxx

Dear Mr Tory,
I am writing to inform you of my concern about the proposed closure of the Rushden hydrotherapy pool. This pool is of great importance to the many disabled people living in the local area. It is accessed by three local special schools, who do not have a facility such as this on their own sites, in addition to parents and carers of people with learning disabilities, physical disabilities, and complex needs, being able to book and use the pool directly. 
Hydrotherapy is very beneficial to those who are unable to exercise in conventional ways. There is evidence to suggest that hydrotherapy can prevent people from needing expensive treatment in the future; therefore, keeping this facility open will save the NHS money, improve the lives of local people, and keep a much-loved facility within the heart of the community, as there is no other such facility within a 30 mile radius. 
I would appreciate your help in this matter. 
Kind regards. 
Yours sincerely,
Aileen Johnson.

Hiya sarah, been a while.  Hope your xmas went ok.  We did both sets of in-laws which was a bit tiring travel wise.  All went well.  Nice to see Dublin, although it was bloody freezing.  Caught a roddy doyle play about the economic situation and saw some cousins I had lost touch with which was good.  Otherwise, lots of presents and too much food and drink I’m afraid.  Suffolk was a bit quieter and as ever warmer and more scenic.  Lots of mad nephews with their funny stories of university life etc.  Now back to work with no holiday and no money.  But still… Hope to catch up soon, take care, dave

Dear Mr Tory,  I write with reference to the drastic reduction in hours of opening for our local library.  I have never seen you or your family there, so you may not think of it as local, but it is a cherished local meeting place and local resource.  I can only plead with you to use any means available to you to not let this happen.  I can understand the need for some cuts, but while there are bankers still receiving bonuses and tax avoiders still hoarding their wealth overseas (apart from when they donate to your party) this seems a cruel and short-sighted cut to make.  Surely as a society we need to open up the opportunities for our young people in order to get us out of our economic mess rather than make it worse. Please think again, yours sincerely,  Dave Peters

Hi Jill
How’s things with you?  We have just got back from our holiday and I’m back in work starting to feel like we’ve never been away!  As you probably remember, we went to New Zealand to see my brother and stayed with him and his wife for about 10 days, but managed to fit in a brief stay in Singapore and Sydney, Australia on the way.   In Sydney we met up with our friend Annette that I hadn’t seen for some years, we were at College together.  Singapore was amazing, one of the nicest cities I’ve ever been to, and same with Sydney.  The boat trip into the harbour in Sydney was one of the highlights of our holiday.
It was lovely to see my brother who I only see every couple of years, and great to see where they are living. They are very happy there.  But it’s much too far away from home for me!
Love

To Whom It May Concern
I am writing to express my concern at the closure of the local library in Grappenhall.  It has always been a focus for the community and there are many people who rely on it.  I always took my children when they were small, it encouraged them to read which is such an important part of their education.  I know many old people who use it regularly too, and it’s somewhere they can meet up with their neighbours and friends and have a chat, often they don’t see many other people in their day.
I hope that this decision can be reconsidered, before we lose a valuable asset to the community.
Yours Sincerely

Dear Mrs Hart,i am very concerned that the council have said that they will be collecting our bins monthly instead of fortnightly,and i wish to say i am very unhappy with this as with the smell,dogs,and rats,so i would appreciate you getting back to me on this.

Hi Jerry,
Long time no see!  I thought that if we met at the Dog and Fox on Oxford  Road around 330pm on |Thursday we could then talk about the holiday we wnast to take.
|See you there!

I think I told you that I went to Birmingham last week for a short break.  That last time I was there the station was  under construction, but now it’s a lot better.  Its got all sort of chrome and clear displays for everyone to see.  It’s still New Street, though.  The train arriveds in this tunnel and kyou struggle to get out.  Nevertheless, B’hsm is a good plasce to visit.  I thought the library was lovely- full of people and lots to see.  The Indian meal I had was fabulous, as well.
Why don’t you come new time?

Dear Sir,
I have written to you before about the issue of the new laws your government wants to introduce about lobbying.  It seems to me that the impact of this law will be felt by charities, such as Oxfam and Cafod, who will want to let people kniow about the impact your government’s policuies will have on the poor, not only in this country, but in the wider world generally.  You are a Lib-Dem, but you seem to want to justify the Tories perspective on everything, incvludfing the NHS and school reford, as you call it.  You need not ask for my support at the next election; I shall withhold it.
Yoiurs

Dear Diane

Just  a quickie to remind you that we will be meeting up on Friday, 21 June at 12.00 noon at the Britainnia Hotel.  This is a meeting of the Magnificent Seven which will take place at High Noon on the Longest Day!
I am very much looking forward to meeting up with everyone again and I have so much to tell you all, the main being that I am about to become a grandmother again in December.   Alexandra and Tommy are, of coure, delighted with this and they are both looking forw

Dear Marilyn
Thanks very much for your recent phone call and I am sorry that I was not here to speak to you.  
We were on holiday that week in Torquay and we had a lovely time with the crowd that we went with.  They are all very similar in personalities to our own and we had a great time in the evenings.  (Forgot to mention that the hotel was all inclusive so this wetted our appetites in the evening!)  Maybe next year both you and Tommy will be

Dear Ms Blears
I am writing to you about the lack of street cleansing that is currently taking place in Irlam and Cadishead.  For some time now the road and pathways around the shops on Stockport Road have been in quite an unsatisfactory state due to the lack of litter removal in this area.    In addition to this there is also the matter of youths congregating around the shops during the evening and nightime.  Sometimes they are very noisy and this is having a detrimental affect on the elderly who live in the sheltered housing around

Hi Yvonne,
Haven’t seen you for ages,  so can we meet for coffee next Thursday – that’s the 28th Nov. at the Deli in the village?  I thought maybe about 10.30, but if that doesn’t suit you just let me know!

Hi Margie,
Hope you are both well!  Just got back from lovely holiday in Lyme Regis.  Weather was wonderful, and we rented a house right on the beach!  Most of our time was spent on the beach, but we did go mackerel fishing,  and caught enough fish for really good barbecue!
Lots of love,   Kat  xxx

Dear Mr. Leech,
I’m extremely concerned at the possibility of the Post Office in Didsbury closing.  This would make life very difficult for all local residents, especially for the disabled and elderly who might not be able to get to another Post Office.  Please can you try to bring this matter up at the next Prime Ministers question time?
Thank you for your help,
Catherine Price.

Dear Mark,
I hope you are keeping well.   I would like to draw your attention to the number of mature trees in the area, that the council have taken down on the grounds of safety.  I have written to them on many occasions and yhey have assured me that they have a programme of replacing trees when they are removed.  I have seen no evidence of this over

Hi Jill 
We arranged to get together tomorrow.  How about meeting at the Corner House, at 12 noon, on 27 January?  I'll get there by train and then walk from Piccadilly, I expect you'll come by bus from Chorlton.  We can have lunch and then maybe go to see a film.
Look forward to seeing you.

Hello Ruth
Had a good time on the Isla of Wight coach trip with my cousin Jenny.  Long journey to get there, but worth it in the end!  We enjoyed several coach trips to places of interest, but unfortunately Osborne House was not among them - to get there we went by bus - two each way -  and for me that was quite an exhausting day.  But the house was interesting, a big contrast between Victoria's private rooms and the ones used for entertaining which were very grand.
Hotel OK, especially the food, and I even had a sea view!  Weather could have been a lot better, it was cold for the time of year I thought.
Hope to see you soon, and that you're keeping OK.

Dear Mr Shepherd
I feel strongly that I must protest about the plans to withdraw funding from the local stroke club at Withington Hospital.  The club is largely self-financing, but nevertheless needs a bit of extra help, previously provided by the local Council  to keep going.  As you realise I'm sure, the club is a lifeline for many elderly people who have been disabled to a greater or less extent by a stroke.  They really do appreciate their monthly meeting, with musical entertainment or a talk, plus the opportunity to meet friends in congenial surroundings.  I do

Hi Sue,
Nice to hear from you again, let’s meet up next week. Would Wednesday suit? We can meet outside Marks and Spencers and had a look inside and a coffee. Would 12 noon suit?  Hope this is Ok and look forward to seeing you then.

Hi Sue,
Must tell you about Saturday; we were invited by Jodrell Bank to take our telescopes and go to a Girls Night Out.  Three of us went from our astronomical Society and it was a lovely clear night.  We could show the girls Jupiter and its 4 moons, they were really beautiful. We also had a ‘scope aimed at the moon which was half full and you could see all the craters down the middle. It was pretty cold but all the girls were very keen and I think we inspired quite a few. We were brought a cup of coffee half way through the evening which kept us warm.  Hope to do the same thing again next winter.

Dear John Leech,
I would like to draw your attention to the situation on the Pelican crossing opposite St Ambrose Church on Princess Parkway.  The number of cars that shoot the red light is a real issue, it happens regularly and I have almost got knocked over a couple of times.  Might I suggest that a camera be mounted above the crossing to catch people who do this and endanger life? It would act as a deterrent if nothing else, and may help to cut down the number of people who do this and possibly save a life.
I do hope you will give this your serious consideration.
Kind regards,
Justine Smith

Hi Chery
Had a fantastic time on Amsterdam last week. We spent a whole day in the Reiksmuseum. Too much really but a  cuppa and some waffles in the sunshine got us all relaxed again.
